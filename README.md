HAHSIRAMA ABOUT TO SPIT THAT FIRE!!! 0:41

My name is hashirama senju
mess with anyone I know, know that im coming for you
it could be you madara or even the land of the sand
ill come full force on your ass true several thousand hands
villages tremble, to their knees from the sound of my name 
from my bliss bringing hands the beasts they tame
leader of the senju, historys strongest clan,
and we open up a can of whoop-ass to any clan stepping on our land
shit... now this is just the start
now listen a little longer while I put you ninjas in the dark
I am the bringer of darkness  (his move)
your will and light ill harness 
step up to me in combat 
kill ya leave ya ninjas armless
ok madara let me take you on a trip 
try to mess with me my ninja and your body will be ripped
back then we were friends we were just little kids
but then we had to seperate because of what our fathers did
but now I gotta do, what I had to do 
protect my village my friends and everybody in my crew
I tried to bring peace to you but you wouldnt listen
then I had to whip and you staying (in the village) is something you be wishing
talking about my brother tobirama
he a killa too, he already took out izuna
you think you can damage with that fan on your back
with my sage mode ill give you 1000 b***h smacks
im the father of shinobi,everything I originate
you tired to copy my jutsus but you cant beat me its too late,
you couldnt beat so my wood style you tried to imitate
but once I lock in my sage mode, I also lock in your fate
hating on me because im the hokage
and im on the mind of red head mito uzumaki
yea im the first the second is tobirama
when the legends speak to us, they call by "legend-sama"
step on the battlefield compare our chakras
you got uchihas in the back laughing callin you a baka
red marks, hands signs, my chakras on the rise,
i look like hashirama but im a beast in disguise﻿
